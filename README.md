My research projects for 2018
I'm an operational meteorologist who likes applied research and R2O. I like cool projects that culminate in tangible benefits.
I intend to use the Giovanni interface to explore NASA observational datasets and maps, in an effort to see how these can be used to assist in either operational forecasting or analysis of past events.
